# com_membershiptaxreport

A tax report component for Membership Pro (https://www.joomdonation.com/joomla-extensions/membership-pro-joomla-membership-subscription.html)

This component can show the VIES ("zusammenfassende Meldung") and MOSS (now OSS) reports to make filing the necessary tax report easier. If you're in the EU and sell software with Membership Pro, you might find this useful. It works out of the box for Germany since it excludes german customers from the exports.
